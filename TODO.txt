Additions:
    * Add procedural terrain generation.
    * Add water physics.
    * Add entities with AI.
    * Add ragdoll physics.
    * Add better way to handle animations and transition between them.

Fixes:
    * Renderer needs a better interface so that you can draw, for example, nothing.
    * All data about the world including lights should belong in World class.
    * Add NonCopyable interface for things like Mesh and Shader.
    * Figure out why DAE/FBX models aren't working (likely a blender issue).
