Additions:
    * Add PBR.
    * Add anti-aliasing (apparently MSAA doesn't work with deferred pipeline).
    * Need a logger class for easier debugging, it should accept a message and type (graphics, physics, audio, etc).
    * Add procedural terrain generation.
    * Add water physics.
    * Add entities with AI.
    * Add ragdoll physics.
    * Add better way to handle animations and transition between them.

Fixes:
    * Issue with pinpoint holes in geometry, possibly a triangle rasterization issue or related to skybox render.
    * Should use more interface blocks https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Advanced-GLSL
    * Transformable should just store one quaternion for rotation instead of Euler angles (same for Camera probably).
    * No need for the position map in g-buffer.
    * Look into reversing the z-buffer for better precision across scene.
    * Need a better way to render models so that gl calls are minimized.
        - Possibly a scene graph with dirty flag optimization, or other method to group draw calls by shader/materials.
    * Renderer needs a better interface so that you can draw, for example, nothing.
    * Add NonCopyable interface for things like Mesh and Shader.
    * Figure out why DAE/FBX models aren't working (likely a blender issue).
